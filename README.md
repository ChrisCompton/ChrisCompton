### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have had a wonderful career of innovation in public safety, federal service and service to the public, with almost 30 years of experience in informatics, software development and information technology. I have a unique blend of private and public sector service, across a wide spectrum of web and mobile technologies, including a healthy dose of legal, policy and project management experience in the U.S. Government. I fought fires, ate smoke and gave care when seconds counted for 10 of my younger years as an Emergency Medical Technician and volunteer firefighter.
